Certainly, here's a step-by-step guide to setting up a simple web application using PHP and MySQL in XAMPP:

**Step 1: Create a Folder**

1. Open File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (macOS).
2. Navigate to the `htdocs` directory in your XAMPP installation. By default, it's located at `C:\xampp\htdocs` on Windows and `/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs` on macOS.
3. Create a new folder in the `htdocs` directory. You can name it "experiment" or any name you prefer.

**Step 2: Setup the Database**

1. Open XAMPP Control Panel.
2. Start the Apache and MySQL modules by clicking the "Start" buttons in the "Actions" column.
3. Open a web browser and enter "http://localhost/phpmyadmin" to access phpMyAdmin.

**Step 3: Create a Table in the Database**

1. In phpMyAdmin, click on the "Databases" tab.
2. Enter a name for your database (e.g., "test") in the "Create database" field.
3. Click the "Create" button to create the database.
4. After creating the database, select it from the left sidebar.
5. Click the "SQL" tab.
6. Copy and paste the following SQL query to create a table named "mytable" with three columns: `id`, `name`, and `email`. The `id` column is set as the primary key and auto-incremented.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE mytable (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
   );
   ```

7. Click the "Go" button to execute the query. This will create the table in your database.

**Step 4: Create index.php in the Created Folder**

1. Inside the "experiment" folder you created in Step 1, create a new file named `index.php`.
2. Write or copy your PHP and HTML code for the CRUD application into this `index.php` file.

**Step 5: Access Your Application**

1. Make sure the Apache and MySQL modules are running in the XAMPP Control Panel.
2. Open a web browser.
3. Navigate to your application by entering the following URL in the address bar:

   ```
   http://localhost/experiment
   ```

4. This will load your PHP and HTML files located in the "experiment" folder, allowing you to perform CRUD operations.

You have now successfully set up a web application with PHP and MySQL in XAMPP. Follow these steps, and you'll be able to access and use your application on your local server.
